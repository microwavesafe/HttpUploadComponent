This is a package of the available files in the main repository and the contrib directory. The package dependencies are for Ubuntu 16.04 so YMMV.

From command line run

$ dpkg-deb --build prosody-httpuploadcomponent-0.0.1/

to create a debian package that installs alongisde nginx and prosody. You need to configure

/etc/prosody/HttpUploadComponent/config.yml

component_jid: <upload url>

whitelist:
  <xmpp domain>
  <another xmpp domain>

get_url : https://<upload url>
put_url : https://<upload url>


/etc/prosody/conf.d/upload.cfg.lua

in disco_items <upload url>
in Component <upload url>


/etc/nginx/sites-available/prosody-httpuploadcomponent

server_name  <upload url>
